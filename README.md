### Notice:
This bot is still under heavy development. The purpose of this bot is to track guild member's activity and dedication to the guild, and to reward players who contribute the most GEXP/playtime. Points are given out weekly, and roles will be synced on Hypxiel (at a later date).

## Issues
If you find any issues please report them in the Issues tab, and be descriptive. Don't just say `it doesn't work`, explain what you did and what the result was.
